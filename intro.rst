======================================
From runserver to N-tier architectures
======================================

This guide aims to address two questions:

1. How do you server a Django app in production?
2. How do you get updates from your computer to your server

There are lots of related topics and advanced methods, and while this guide
will cover some and mention many, the primary goal is to give people a solid
footing just answering these two primary questions.

* Runsever is great, but its at home only on your computer
* What a typical (small) web architecture looks like
* web servers and application servers
* Running a process
